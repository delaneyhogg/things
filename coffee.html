        <p> I like to drink and to make coffee. My favorite kinds of coffee to drink are iced caramel lattes and pumpkin spice cold brew from Starbucks. Starbucks has always been my go to coffee shop, but one of my favorite things to do when traveling is to visit different coffee shops all around the country. I write down a lot of the local places I end up visiting and it is so fun to look back on these experiences. Whenever I visit a new place, a carmael latte is my go to drink (hot or iced). This way, when I try a new drink, its easy to compare the quality to past ones I have tried.</p>

         <p> I also like to make coffee. I have my very own coffee station at home where I can make lattes and different espresso drinks! I am still working on perfecting my cold brew copy cat from Starbucks, but I will figure out a dupe eventually. I have recently started to experiment with new flavor combinations as I make lattes. My most recent favorite includes a honey and cinnamon latte but I am also working on perfecting the perfect pumpkin spice latte for fall </p>
