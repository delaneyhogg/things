        <p> I like to shop at Goodwill and second hand stores to find objects to flip and make into something new. My favorite stores to thrift regularly at are both in Richmond, Virginia. I like Goodwill the most because the stuff inside is less likely to be picked through and there is a better chance to find cooler items for less money. The pink chairs shown in the photo below are one of my favorite all time purchases. I paid $35 for four of these light pink chairs!</p>

         <p> I have seen some really cool things during my experiences thrifting. My favorite thing that I ever found was a Nespresso coffee machine, new in the box. My younger sister and I also take clothes that we find together and will dye them, crop them, or make them into something new.  </p>
