        <p> Hello everyone! My name is Delaney Hogg and I am so excited for this semester, even with the <Strong> pandemic </Strong>and other things going on. I recently graduated from East Carolina University with a degree in Business Marketing and a certificate in Professional Selling. I am the third generation in my family to attend East Carolina but my step mom is a Hokie! </p>

            <p> I am excited for this class because I already have some experience in social media and content management. I think my experiences with helping to run a website will help me find relatable experiences that could help my fellow classmates. </p>
